It's freshman Semester. You’re in line for halal fried chicken wings at the Busey evans dining hall,
and you hear out of the blue -

“I’M JANET FOELLINGER.”

The speaker has a mild British accent, and looks at you to introduce yourself.

“My name’s Haley” you say, “Haley Prochilo. So do you have something to do with the auditorium then?” you ask

“THE GREAT FOELLINGER AUDITORIUM WAS DEDICATED TO MY GRANDMOTHER IN THE YEAR 1985”

# 1
Say that foellinger auditorium is kind of a mess

# 2
Compliment the auditorium even though you’re not particularly fond of it, just to be nice.

# 3
Ask her about the halal fried chicken wings
