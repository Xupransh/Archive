You agree to go to Chicago with them, you live close by in the suburbs and do miss your parents, so you call them
and tell them that you'll be there for the night.

"This was a great decision" you think to yourself, while driving in an Audi R8 Cabriolet.
The song "You ain't seen nothing yet" by Bachman Turner Overdrive is playing in the background. Janet Foellinger
might seem a little extra at first, but is a really genuine, thoughtful, and smart person.

(You end up becoming best friends in the future).

You reach the restaurant. Some of Janet's friends from the UK are also there, and oddly enough some people who look
like bodyguards - with earpieces, black suits and somber expressions - are standing at various odd spots.

She goes around the table introducing her friends. "...and this, of course, is Emma Watson".

You paid no attention to the fact that Emma Watson was literally sitting across from you!

"Oh Hi!! Big fan of your work Emma!" You say. You respect Emma Watson for her recent endeavors and also her
impressive acting career.

Basically, you have an awesome night, make awesome friends, eat awesome food, and have detailed discussions
about topics including quantum computing and nihilism.

fin.
