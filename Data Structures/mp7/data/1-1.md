You hastily stuff some nuggets into a tiny tupperware container you carry around with you at all times.

Later in the afternoon, while waiting for the 22N Illini (limited hours) at the south union bus stop, you open your
tiny tupperware container (the one you keep with you all the time) and take a mighty bite out of the nugget.

Oh no.

"This is a CHICK'N NUGGET" It's one of those nuggets that are vegan, and you don't like those personally. Just a matter
of taste, you don't have anything against vegan food.

It starts raining. This is what you get for being rude to a someone who simply wanted your friendship.

fin.
