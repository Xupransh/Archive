"Oh yeah I love having classes at the auditorium.."

"The great foellinger auditorium you mean?" Janet Foellinger interrupts you.

"Uh yeah. And there's so many fun things that happen there all the time, it's great."

You don't like the auditorium that much, but you're generally nice to people, so you go along.

"Thanks!" Janet Foellinger says. "You seem like a nice ol' gal.." Janet Foellinger's speech patterns are all over the
place, you find that interesting. "Would you like to accompany me to dinner tonight? A few of my friends from the
UK might join us depending on where we go."
