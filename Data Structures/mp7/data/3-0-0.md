"Ooh I'd love too! But my BUS101 project is due very soon." Your BUS101 project is due really soon, and your team
members aren't really being super co-operative. It's funny how sometimes the whole project can be compromised simply
because of poor communication.

Like, honestly, if only you had open and honest communication with your team members. This whole project would be
finished so smoothly. But nooo, no one wants to do their part of the project, it's so unfair.

And worst of all, there are 2 members in your group, with names Brendon and Braydon, and you don't know which is which.
You've already asked them around 4 times. Group projects are honestly the worst. One of Brendon-Brandon thought it was
alright to give a 5 year warranty on a paper plate.  

Honestly, at this point, you should consider changing teams. Your team simply isn't doing the project correctly.
An integral part of the project is learning how to co-operate effectively, and that simply isn't there.
